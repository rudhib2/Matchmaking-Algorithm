The output and correctness of each algorithm – You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.

The answer to your leading question – You should direct address your proposed leading question. How did you answer this question? What did you discover? If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team.

The inital goal of the project was to build a matchmaking program that could perform 2 tasks: 
- find compatable matches for people in the form of a list, ranking the top ten most compatable ids for a given id from the data set
- find the compatability ratio between two specific people, when given the two ids from the dataset

In addition to these two tasks, the team added a few additional functionalities
- finding the category of "desirability" a person from the dataset falls under, based on their attribute score "ranking". The categories are "high", "average", and "low", each signifying how "desirable" other people would find them. This information is useful to an individual who wants to know how easy it will be for them to find a match.
- finding the category of "standards" a person from the dataset falls under based on their preference score "ranking" The categories are "high", "average", and "low", each signifying how high a person's "standards" are. This information is valuable to an individual who wants to know how easy it will be for them to find a match.
