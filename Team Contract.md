# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our group will be meeting on Friday's from 4:30-7:00pm. Our group member, Janani, will be taking meeting minutes. We will also be meeting in person in the Siebel basement.


2. **Assistance** 
We will have a groupchat on WhatsApp and can contact each other through this platform to send important links, attachments, or messages. We expect each other to respond within 2 hours. 


3. **Respect** 
We'll make sure when we're making decisions that we go around and take into account everyone's opinions. If we ever are in a situation where we disagree on something, we will come to a compromise and try to implement everyone's thoughts/ideas. 


## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We plan on addressing unexpected complications or unforeseen circumstances by coming to office hours or emailing our TA. If it's not a major problem, we plan to just look up potential solutions on the internet to see if anyone else has had the same issue as us. We will assign workload on a week to week basis, depending what interests each of the members, our responsibilities, and strengths and weaknesses. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
About 4.5 hours of work is expected out of us, including the 2.5 hours we'll meeting in person every week. We estimate about 2 hours of independent work. Depending on the errors we are facing or progress we need to make, we may spend more or less time. We are accounting for other responsibilities we have, RSO's we are a part of, as well as our classes which is why we picked our meeting for a time that works for all of us. We will address new conflicts through our group chat or by coming to office hours. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If we have a disagreement, we'll communicate and make sure that we come to a compromise that takes into account everyone's opinion. We will also make sure that we are respectful and cordial when suggesting ideas and listenting to others. In situations where one or more members have not accomplished tasks or where members are habitually late, we will talk to them to see if they need any help and we will make sure that we get the resources to accomplish their tasks. In the worst case scenario, we will contact the course staff. There are currently no hypothetical situations that we want to discuss ahead of time.
