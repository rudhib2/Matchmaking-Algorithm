// Compatible Test Cases
// Given a compatible pair – should return compatible
    // Have to pass prelim check & pass threshold check
// Given a not compatible pair – should return not compatible
    // One test case where the pair does not pass prelim check so it should just return not compatible (even if it passes threshold check)
    // One test case where the pair passes prelim check but does not pass threshold check
// Invalid input should return invalid
    // Same id passed in for both 
    // 3 ids passed in instead of 2
    // 1 id passed in instead of 2

TEST CASES ~ manual work (Janani & Rudhi)
    Compatible tests
        Compatible pair
            A ~ 4
            B ~ 14
            Prelims ~
                A’s gender pref = 0
                A’s age pref = 23
                A’s race pref = 2
                A’s rel type = 1
                B’s gender, age, race, rel type = A’s prefs
            Threshold ~
                A’s score (calculated based on A’s prefs) = 9 + 6 + 6 + 9 + 7 = 37 * 10 = 370
                B’s score (calculate based on B’s attribs) = 9 + 9 + 9 + 2 + 4 = 33 * 10 = 330
                Within 100 threshold so compatible
        Not compatible pair – do not pass prelim 
            A ~ 6
            B ~ 10

                A’s rel type = 1
                B’s gender, age, rel type do not pass 
                Does not pass prelim check so not compatible
        Not compatible pair – pass prelim NOT threshold
            A ~ 1
            B ~ 34
            Prelims ~ 
                A’s gender pref = 0

                A’s score (calculated based on A’s prefs) = 1 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 2 = 18 * 100 = 180
